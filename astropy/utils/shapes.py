    """Mixin class to provide shape-changing methods.

    The class proper is assumed to have some underlying data, which are arrays
    or array-like structures. It must define a ``shape`` property, which gives
    the shape of those data, as well as an ``_apply`` method that creates a new
    instance in which a `~numpy.ndarray` method has been applied to those.

    Furthermore, for consistency with `~numpy.ndarray`, it is recommended to
    define a setter for the ``shape`` property, which, like the
    `~numpy.ndarray.shape` property allows in-place reshaping the internal data
    (and, unlike the ``reshape`` method raises an exception if this is not
    possible).

    This class also defines default implementations for ``ndim`` and ``size``
    properties, calculating those from the ``shape``.  These can be overridden
    by subclasses if there are faster ways to obtain those numbers.

    """

    # Note to developers: if new methods are added here, be sure to check that
    # they work properly with the classes that use this, such as Time and
    # BaseRepresentation, i.e., look at their ``_apply`` methods and add
    # relevant tests.  This is particularly important for methods that imply
    # copies rather than views of data (see the special-case treatment of
    # 'flatten' in Time).
